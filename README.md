# Turbo Switcher

A small service I made for my friend to turn on turbo mode based on the availability of AC Power
- runs every 5 seconds to check status of AC Power connectivity, if AC Power is connected then turbo mode is turned on and if it is otherwise then turned off

## To install 
```
git clone https://github.com/rvsmooth/turbo_switcher
cd turbo_switcher 
bash install.sh
